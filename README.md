## Planning For Future enhancement


1) Implement toggle between win / loss  and continuous play to incorporate some principles of Flow. The basic function would remove the round limit for a win and only shorten the next sequence on an incorrect guess .

2) Implement variable sequence speed dependant on round of play.
3) Improve sound quality on mobile
